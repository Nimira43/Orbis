# Background Math

## Linear Algebra

##### The study of Vectors, Vector Spaces (Linear Spaces), Linear Transformations and Systems of Linear Equations

##### Provides a framework for understanding the properties and operations of these mathematical objects which can be represented using matrices and vectors (scalars)

### Important applications of Linear Algebra in Data Science

1) Data representation and manipulation – example use case = to predict the price of a house using a dataset.

###### Input Features

Area of house
Rooms
Location

###### USE MODEL

###### Output Features

Price

###### Notes

[Area, Rooms, Location, Price]  =>  VECTOR

The parts of the vector quantify the relationship between each other – such as the size of house, number of rooms, the location.

quantify the relationship => covariance, correlation

### Dimensions and Vectors

2 dimension vector = (x, y) or (area, price)
3 dimension vectors = (x, y, z) or (area, price, rooms)

##### Linear algebra works well with higher dimension data

For example:

500 dimensions
v
Dimensionality Reduction
v
To convert for instance into
v
2 dimensions
v
This concept is called PCA (more of that later)
