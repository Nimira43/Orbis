What’s New in Perceptron 3
Separate datasets:

trainInputs / trainLabels → original examples.

testInputs / testLabels → unseen examples, slightly different coordinates.

Training loop: now runs on the test set instead of the training set. This forces Orbis to adapt to new patterns.

Accuracy report: measures performance on the test set, not just memorised training data.

Verdict
-------
Epoch Evolution
Epoch 0 → 2

Starts with [0.2, 0.3] and bias 0.5.

Quickly collapses toward [~0, 0.3] with bias 0.3.

She’s undecided: x1 loses influence, x2 holds steady.

Epoch 3 → 5

x2 grows stronger (0.3 → 0.5).

x1 dips negative (0 → -0.1).

Bias slides down to 0.1.

Orbis leans on x2 as the pencil‑indicator, but x1 starts whispering “eraser.”

Epoch 6 → 9

x1 oscillates around -0.1 to -0.2.

x2 climbs to 0.6.

Bias drifts negative (0 → -0.1).

The tug‑of‑war continues: x2 says “pencil,” x1 says “eraser,” bias tilts toward eraser.

🎭 Verdict
Feature 1 (x1) → weak negative weight, nudging toward “eraser.”

Feature 2 (x2) → stronger positive weight, nudging toward “pencil.”

Bias → slightly negative, defaulting to “eraser” unless x2 is high.

This creates a messier decision boundary than Perceptron 2. Instead of clean separation, Orbis struggles with the test set — hence the 60% accuracy.

🛠 What It Means
Generalisation gap → She memorised the training set perfectly, but falters on unseen data.

Oscillations → Weights don’t stabilise; they swing between epochs, chasing conflicting signals.

Bias drift → Negative bias hurts accuracy when pencils have moderate x2 values.
